# Exploratory Data Analysis with R

## Project Description
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using R. The project consists of various tasks related to data collection, cleaning, and visualization, applying advanced data analysis techniques to semi-structured and unstructured data.

## Files Included
- **Tarea4_FiorellaMartinez.rmd**: The RMarkdown file containing the code and analysis steps.

## Instructions

### Pre-requisites
To run the project, ensure you have R and RStudio installed with the following packages:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyr`
- `readr`

### Data Collection
The project utilizes various datasets:
1. `ventas.csv`: Sales data used to identify the best-performing store.
2. `OIJ_estadisticas_2017.csv`, `OIJ_estadisticas_2018.csv`, `OIJ_estadisticas_2019.csv`, `OIJ_estadisticas_2020.csv`, `OIJ_estadisticas_2021.csv`, `OIJ_estadisticas_2022.csv`: Crime statistics for different years, merged for analysis.
3. `temperaturaEuropa.csv`: Temperature data for European cities used for principal component analysis.
4. `Ovsicori.rds`: A dataset containing information on Twitter posts related to seismic events in Costa Rica.

### Data Processing
- Data is cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary.
- The datasets are merged for analysis purposes when required.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
Several types of analyses are performed:
- Sales data visualization using different types of plots to determine the best-performing store.
- Bar and line charts visualizing crime statistics by location and time period.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to temperature data, with custom visualizations using `ggplot2`.

### Expected Results
Through this analysis, the project demonstrates the application of R for performing exploratory data analysis on various datasets, providing insights that can aid decision-making.

### Submission
Submit the following:
- RMarkdown file (`Tarea4_FiorellaMartinez.rmd`).
