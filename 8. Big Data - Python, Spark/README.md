# Big Data Practical Project

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a practical Big Data application where the sources of information and the type of analysis to be performed are chosen. The project consists of the following stages: data collection, storage, processing, and analysis, using the main tools of Python, Spark, and MongoDB.

## Instructions

### Pre-requisites
Before starting the project, ensure the following installations:
- MongoDB (local installation)
- Java (JDK and JRE)
- Spark
- Anaconda IDE-Python
- Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- Python extension for VSC

Create and use a Python environment named `Mongo-Python` and install the following libraries:
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `pylint`
- `pymongo`
- `tkinter`

Create a new working folder to save all generated project files.

### Project Instructions

#### Data Collection
Use a web scraping technique to select a webpage from the market, extract data, and perform the analysis.

#### Data Storage
The collected data can be uploaded to a MongoDB database or saved as flat files (CSV, TSV, Excel, etc.) generated from the web scraping process.

#### Data Processing
Using Python and Spark data processing techniques, perform the following tasks:
- Select necessary columns for analysis.
- Remove rows with empty values.
- Transform string columns to numeric sequences.
- Adjust null values.
- Remove duplicate values.

#### Data Analysis and Visualization
After preparing the data sources, conduct the analysis and present the results using the following steps:
- Define the type of analysis (prescriptive or predictive) to be performed on the treated data.
- Use `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib` libraries to visualize the results and present them using graphs.

### Expected Results
The goal is to demonstrate through practical development that the learned techniques and tools enable the development of a project analyzing large volumes of information through different stages: data collection, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization. The results will support decision-making by projecting future trends or analyzing current patterns in organizational data.
